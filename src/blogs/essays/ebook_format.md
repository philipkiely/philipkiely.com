Summary:

After publishing several ebooks, I have a process

## Markdown

* Good to write in
* Matches the level of syntax my brain thinks with
* Automatic headers, links, footnotes, etc

## Pandoc

Turn markdown into a microsoft word doc

A little different for each book but let's do a dangerous guide because I have to make a bunch of them.

* Use styles pane not WYSIWYG
  * Body Styles - Why font
  * Header Styles - Why font & color
* A5 paper, margins
* Page numbering

* Images
* Making a TOC
* Exporting to PDF (embed fonts)

## PDF formatting

* Making the cover
* Attaching cover and other full-width images
* Testing Links

## Bonus if time: Apple Pages Formatting
