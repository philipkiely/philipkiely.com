Summary: Rapid development in AI (today&colon; GPT-4, Midjourney 5, Whisper) are redefining what's possible across the industry. Will this dethrone or entrench incumbents?

*Silicon Valley*, season 1 finale *(spoiler alert!)*. Richard Hendrix has created, in theory, the best compression algorithm possible and founded a startup to bring the technology to market.

Richard & co sit in the audience and watch as megacorp Hooli CEO Gavin Belson delivers a keynote announcing an equivalently powerful compression algorithm integrated into Hooli's entire suite of services. Their technical moat evaporates in a single scene.

When I read Microsoft's [copilot announcement](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/06/introducing-microsoft-dynamics-365-copilot/) and [future of work post](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/ai-a-whole-new-way-of-working), I was reminded of this scene. And I was reminded of it again when GPT-4 wiped away an entire generation on GPT-3.5 optimization startups with improvements to the core model's capabilities.

Even AI-specific technical differentiators like prompt engineering are unsteady ground. Just look at the [rapid improvement in Midjourney quality](https://twitter.com/bensbitesdaily/status/1637477841607458819) from V2 to V5 on the same prompt.

Advancements in tech eventually reach ubiquity. But today's LLMs and other generative models are so good and so intuitive that they're being integrated faster than any other platform shift. Cutting edge capabilities are just an API call away.

Will these rapid advancements and the resulting lack of technical moats bridge non-technical moats or wrap all the way back around to deepening them?

Another spoiler alert: I don't know! Let's investigate together.

## Non-Technical Moat: Distribution

Hooli and Gavin Belson's main advantage was distribution. As a tech megacorp, they had a suite of products — fictional analogues for Google Drive, Microsoft Word, Android, and more — that they could integrate the new compression technology into. There would be no incentive for users to switch to some startup's platform for these capabilities. Instead, they would just show up in the tools they already used.

Replace compression algorithms with LLMs and you have today's situation. Why use a purpose-built AI writing tool when I can just start typing in a Google Doc?

I'm doing a small experiment around this question right now with SEO.

Early on in college, I created a poetry generator to write a sonnet for me for English class. Somehow, this simple bit of JavaScript that chopped up and regurgitated Shakespeare's sonnets became the third-ranking "sonnet generator" on Google search with over 2,000 user per month.

A couple of weeks ago, I replaced it with a new UI powered by GPT-3.5. It has stepped up the second search result and doubled its monthly user base. There is zero technical moat on this project. The poetry generation prompt is just "Write a $POEM_TYPE about $SUBJECT". 

As I improve the page with more types of poetry, will it climb up to the first spot on search results and perhaps even rank for more general terms like "poetry generator?" Or will it be overtaken by larger publishers integrating the same technology into their own sites?

When two products have similar quality, distribution and branding determines who wins. And we all have access to the same GPT APIs.

## Non-Technical Moat: Data

Gavin Belson finishes the keynote by introducing Shakira as a surprise guest performer.

ChatGPT will happily "write the lyrics of a song in the style of Shakira." Some lyrics — "I've got my tambourine in hand // And I'm ready to take a stand" — are dubious, but many are number-one hit material.

The problem? It only takes three lines for the model to replicate an iconic lyric, "hips don't lie." Song lyrics are notorious for their strict copyright protection, and aspiring digital singers risk running afoul of these restrictions.

Intellectual property is just one type of data. For companies with large proprietary datasets, AI offers a great path to expanding their moat by building models fine-tuned on this dataset. These specialized models will assist with problem-solving in specific domains and require industry-specific knowledge to use effectively.

So companies with distribution, intellectual property, and proprietary data are safe. What about the rest of us?

## Non-Technical Moat: Determination

Dejected, Richard and company head back to their hotel room. Inspired by a lewd discussion among his friends, Richard shuts himself in a room to code and emerges in time for the final pitch competition with a new algorithm that far exceeds the theoretical limit for lossless compression.

Technical moat restored.

But as the seasons progress, each of Richard's innovations is stolen, copied, or reverse engineered as his company scrambles to define and scale a viable business model.

Staying current when technical moats have a lifetime measured in weeks takes determination and discipline. It's just as exhausting as it is exhilarating. There are no laurels to rest on.

I believe this determination will result in more open-source of models and tooling for both specialized tasks and general use. Right now, ChatGPT going down brings half the AI-powered internet down with it, but I don't think that will remain true for long. Today's ubiquitous models and their successors will remain an essential pillar of the industry, but there will be many niches to fill within a broader ecosystem of AI.
